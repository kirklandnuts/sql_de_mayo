    "Welcome back to the second half of your adventure with SQL! By now, you should be comfortable with writing simple queries and selecting attributes from a table based on certain conditions. If at any point you feel like you need to review, take a breather and jump back into the beginner notebook to refresh. \n",

    "In this section you'll be exploring SQL joins and how to merge tables in a relational database. Let's jump right into it!\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is a join?\n",
    "\n",
    "When broken down, the mechanics of a join are pretty straightforward.  To perform a join you need two items: two tables and a join condition.  The tables contain the rows to be combined, and the join condition the instructions to match rows together. A common join pattern you’ll come across is joining the primary key of one table to its foreign key.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### What process do we use to break up our data?\n",
    "\n",
    "If you guessed normalization, you are correct.  Through that process we break up dependencies within tables to eliminate update anomalies among other things, but in order to keep relationships, we introduce foreign keys.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s take an example from the sample database.  Consider the following data model involving the Employees and Orders table.  In this model each employee can place zero or more orders. The EmployeeID is the primary key in the Employees table and foreign key in the Orders table.  For each employee there can be none, one, or perhaps many orders.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](img/Joining-Tables-Data-Model.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Check the following diagram.  We join the table together we are looking for rows where the EmployeeID matches.  So, for every order, where the EmployeeID = 4, the database will match to the Employees table and match to the corresponding row. In this case that is the employee whose last name is “Baker.”\n",
    "\n",
    "![](img/Inner-Join-In-Action.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "This type of join is called an inner join and we'll go through the explanation in detail later, but if you are dying to try it now, here is the command!\n"
